# Starter Project
  
My First Project was an Arduino Project which uses tilt sensors to activate a servo which spins to a 90 degree angle when the tilt sensor is activated. It was interesting as I learned how a tilt sensor worked and how it uses a conductive material which moves bases on gravity to complete a circuit to sends a signal. I also breadedboarded and soldered and learned the documentation and code nessesary for the use of a servo.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is to make the robot Dance. I contacted a API called musixmatch to make it sing as well but they ghosted me so I used a digital music sheet file called mid to extract song data on a raspberry pi. Raspberry Pi sends signals to the arduino to configure it's max and min. Then sends the notes to the arduino for it to interpret. Which it does.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was just improving my robot. I replaced some of the nuts with nyloc nuts and then I also added a brace for the joint as when the arms move violently the platform moves violently.

# First Milestone
  
The first milestone of this program is that I built a robot arm out of arduino and some servos. With a servo on the base to give side to side motion while havinging another 2 more servos on top to control the motions of the arm before another servo on the end of the arm to control the claws. I ran into some troubles when one of the parts I need got caught up in cleanup but I managed to 3D print the part and everything was and is meh.
