# Starter Project
  

My First Project was an Ardruno Project which uses tilt sensors to activate a servo which spins to a 90 degree angle when the tilt sensor is activated. It was interesting as I learned how a tilt sensor worked and how it uses a conductive material which moves bases on gravity to complete a circuit to sends a signal. I also breadedboarded and soldered. I also learn the documentation for the servo.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.
